üèó CartPole Stabilization with Nonlinear MPC (CASADI)

This project uses CASADI to implement a Nonlinear Model Predictive Controller (NMPC) that balances the classic CartPole from gymnasium. The controller predicts future motion using the system‚Äôs nonlinear dynamics (integrated via RK4) and optimizes control actions over a moving horizon with the Ipopt solver. At each step, only the first optimal force is applied, keeping the pole upright. The code logs and plots üìä the cart‚Äôs position, velocity, pole angle, angular velocity, and control force.
